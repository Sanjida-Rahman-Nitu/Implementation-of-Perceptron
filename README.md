# Perceptron: Theory + Implementation

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explains the Perceptron algorithm both theoretically and practically.

It covers:
- Mathematical intuition behind Perceptron
- Decision boundary concept
- Weight and bias update rule
- Practical implementation
- Model evaluation

The notebook combines theory explanation with hands-on coding.

## 🧠 What is a Perceptron?

The Perceptron is one of the earliest binary classification algorithms.

It is a linear classifier that:
- Takes input features
- Applies weights and bias
- Uses a step activation function
- Outputs class 0 or 1

Mathematical form:

    y = step(w · x + b)

Where:
- w = weights
- x = input features
- b = bias
